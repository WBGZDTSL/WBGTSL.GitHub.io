<p>Compared with social sciences such as psychology and political science, economics first uses quantitative indicators to study the problem of resource allocation to judge the trend of the economic situation. For example, <strong>GDP</strong> (Gross Domestic Product) reflects the national production level and economic situation. <strong>CPI</strong> (Consumer Price Index) is an important indicator to measure the inflation rate. Quantitative indicators have transformed economics, a discipline that studies social theory, into a science, but at the same time, the development of economics has also continuously demonstrated the importance of quantitative research. But economics is not just a game of numbers. Economic stories will have their advantages and disadvantages because of the different narrative methods in the process of communication. The core idea addressed by Robert J. Shiller in this Narrative of economics is that narrative communication is a very important mechanism of economic change and a key predictor. In short, the economic operation mechanism should not be completely based on the assumption of rational people and complete information, but should pay more attention to peopleâ€™s perceptual cognition.</p>
